# Got to pay the bills somehow in the end

So I'm spending all my time doing this.  At some point, it has to 
pay me back.  I'm literally going into debt while I write this.

The original motivation for creating Thunderbolt came out of nascent 
efforts to cobble together a working foundation for some more commercially-minded
efforts I have: __Alcaeus__ and __What's for Dinner?__ and along the
way the distraction / exploration of _Projectus_.

TB is now forming into something I think has some good legs and 
will no doubt be a strong foundation for these projects, and also
potentially many more.

The bones have component expansion potentials:
- workflow utilities
- UI components
- feature libraries
- documentation and blog opportunities

This could of course just be tossed into the world as an NPM package, but I fear
that won't produce enough payback, at least not by itself.  And the fact that
I will be able to use Thunderbolt myself for my own for-pay work may or
may not turn out to justify the effort to create it in the first place.
Such is the nature of risk. But TB is a thing in itself and deserves some
consideration for its own recoupment strategies.

###### Free Open Source Software
Free OSS of course has the best chance of creating a market base in which 
any of the expansion opportunities have a chance to take root, but it
also produces a wider field of competition for those same markets.

While a free OSS offering may still have its place in the end strategy,
being 'just another project' out in the wild is unlikely to go viral on
its own and until it has a certain critical mass of first adopters, 
it will lack credibility as a viable platform to commit to.

Currently, I'm thinking of adopting some of the loose ideas I have
around how to market and monetize _Alcaeus_ can apply to _Thunderbolt_ also.

Of course, the main difference is that _Alcaeus_ inherently requires a cloud
account and therefore a _raison de etre_ for a subscription model.

In that model, the target user is a musician who would like to share his
work with others and hopefully enjoys the experience enough to continue
the subscription.

For Thunderbolt, the target user is a developer searching for a platform they can 
build their killer app idea upon quickly and easily without worry or hassle.
They want:
- a fast learning curve
- support for a variety of application types
- flexible target configuration options
- End-to-end solution path
- Launchpad to distribution into ready marketplaces.
- Confidence that they are not pioneers in the wild: there are many others
who are staking their fortunes on this platform too.
- Solutions for situations within their project as they arise.
- Opportunity to share their solutions with the larger community.

I think all of the above are things TB could claim, but the argument can be made
that all of these things can be provided/facilitated by a basic free
OSS release and community uptake.  I think we need to find something
more compelling as a hook.

###### SaaS
I don't like this model for development platforms, but it's a legitimate
consideration. 

User needs to register with the cloud to use the product, and thus a
subscription can be attached.  

(actually, a self-verifying and scoped license key is downloaded, and
only needs to be renewed when it expires.  Use in the meantime does not
require the cloud.)

I find this to be cynically artificial.  There's no reason a developer
would need to attach to the cloud in order to use this software from a 
purely technical standpoint, and any dev would see that straight away.

Although I'm sure many accept such things as necessary evils to support
the software they prefer, it is still recognized as an artifice that creates 
at least a slight hassle and provides no direct value in itself, and
will turn many away.

We could, of course refactor everything so that key parts of the process
are literally slaved to a cloud operation. But cloud-based development
platforms are often avoided by those who want to have direct control on
their build processes and tools. Some thing could be exported, though.  Publishing, for example, could 
be done this way... that speaks more to a separate value-add plan, however.

###### Paid support
Thunderbolt is a collection of other open-source packages and so
claiming IP rights to it in whole is disengenuous. What _is_ legit, though,
are the process and supporting code that bind this technology stack together
to produce the _Thunderbolt_ framework foundation, and then of course
those components and additions written _for use with Thunderbolt_.

All of these components are subject to update, and update management
in itself can be a PITA, so this is a legitimate rationalization for
asking for a subscription.

Also under the paid-support umbrella, we can lump access to knowledge
base and prioritized ticket responses.

The problem with this model is I am a little worried that the support
demand will exceed my personal abilities to respond. Which means hiring
some support personnel. Okay in principle, but will the revenue stream
be high enough and consistent enough to support this?

###### Dual licensing
We could do Freemium in this way: free + paid versions.  What would
differentiate the free from the paid though?  Components? 
Publishing support? _Projectus_-like features? I think we need to
get more to the end of this journey to see what our bag of stuff looks
like at the time and what the roadmap is before this can be sorted out.

###### Paid extras
This is just a variation on the above, and should probably be an 
option for free users who want to go ala-carte.

###### Paid certification
Interesting idea, but I think this comes after the platform has 
reached a certain minimum level of acceptance and maturity.
I am quite sure there would indeed be a set of norms and best practices
established in such an event, as well as a number of common pitfalls
and antipatterns, so learning courses, exams, seminars, etc all can follow.
Leading up to that, I think we can start to foster things like __meetups and conferences__
and also make outreach at wider-scope __conventions__.

##### What I'm thinking at this moment

A combination of the above:

- Freemium license options from a matrix of features
- components, workflow enhancements, publishing as package features and/or extras
- update packages and notifications built into paid versions
Free version users must seek out update info and apply to individual
components themselves.  
- at least one feature (publishing?) should not be ala carte, and thus
require a subscription.
I predict this inspires a competitive solution to publishing for those 
  who didn't subscribe, but that's okay. (trick hint: make our own 
  competitive product for this under a different name!)
